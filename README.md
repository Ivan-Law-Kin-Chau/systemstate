# Systemstate Editor

The Systemstate Editor emulates something like a graph database on top of a relational database. It has been rewritten to improve the code quality. You can still access the repository for the older version [here](https://github.com/Ivan-Law-Kin-Chau/systemstate-old). 

Compared to the older version (v0.x.x), the newer version (v1.x.x) has the following main differences: 
 - All PHP code were either removed or rewritten to be in JavaScript
 - An Express JS server is used instead of one written from scratch
 - Some features were moved from the server side to the client side
 - The JavaScript code is now written in ES6 instead of in ES5
 - The architecture is now object-oriented instead of procedural
 - Git is thoroughly used, not just as a last minute band-aid solution
 - Of course, a new logo is also used now to reflect all these changes

Due to this improved code quality, I now have a better mental clarity to understand the architecture of my own software than before. Hence, I have achieved a breakthrough at the previous development bottleneck to add the user interface feature. Hopefully, the final version of this software, which I have started thinking about in 2013 and started developing in 2019, is no longer far away! 

[Here](views/dist/resources/documentations.html) is the documentation of the software if you are interested. However, the documentation is currently written for myself to read internally, so it was not written with your ease of understanding in mind. Sorry for the inconvenience.
